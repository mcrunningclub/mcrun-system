- **Event-based triggers:**  
  - Can be set up to run when new rows are added (e.g., via onChange in a connected membership sheet).
- **Time-based triggers:**  
  - Not present by default, but possible for scheduled reminders or follow-ups if extended.

**Purpose:**  
- Automate sending of welcome emails and pass generation for each new member registration.
